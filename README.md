## About this project

This project is the fifth in the Team Treehouse TechDegree Full-Stack JavaScript course.

API Utiliziation is the bases for this project.

### Allowing the user to: 

* Click on a employee's card to view more information about that employee in the form of a modal
* Switch in-between employees information without leaving the modal
* Typing into a search bar to filter through employees

## Features

### 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons

Users can click an on screen 'prev' or 'next' button to swap in-between employee's modals without having to exit the modal itself.

The 'prev' and 'next' buttons display depending on what employee is being displayed. If the first employee is displayed, then the 'prev' button is hidden and vice-versa for the 'next' button if the last employee is displayed.

No buttons are displayed if there is only one employee to display (in relation to a user searching through the employee directory.)

### Search directory

Users can also search through the employee directory using the search bar functionality. 

This search bar will react to typing, thus creating seemless searching for the user. If the user clears the search bar, then the page will repopulate with all employees. 

### Personal styling

Styling was also changed from the original template.

Added color to the pages background as well as each employee's card and modal. 

Employee images have been squared rather than circled on both the employee's card and modal

Each employee card also has an added box shadow.
